Repository for the CFD with OpenFOAM course project

This repo includes the CFD cases that simulate the experimental study by Duncan et al. [2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378383921001149), as well as a simple 2D wave-strucutre interaction model. 
It also includes a wave solver that models a wave formulation containing addition of sin and cosine waves.
